	<h1>No Cry Blackjack</h1>
	<p>Welcome to an online blackjack (aka 21) with friends (or randoms) but with fake money. Technically, since there is no way to spend real money on this game, it's most likely is exempt from gambling rules. But just to be safe, by clicking <a href="">continue</a>, you agree that you are of legal gambling age of your respective country.</p>
